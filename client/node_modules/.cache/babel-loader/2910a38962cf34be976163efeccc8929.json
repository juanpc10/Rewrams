The difference is you can determine the price and you are also giving the benefit to the client. With conventional Facebook or google advertising you get set with a cost that is general and not specific to your business, for example an exposure to 500 users for 5 dollars. This set cost is not customizable and the net revenue of your product is different for you as it is to others that pay the same cost.
